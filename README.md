The script is not so difficult, but user friendly if you do code a bit

words_list = [] - you don't touch it
approved_letters = [] - add your green letters here like ['a', 'b', 'c']
forbidden_letters = [] - add your grey letters here like ['d', 'e', 'f'], but if the letter matches with approved letter - do not add it

Line 21 - just add green letters here (for instance we have 'a' on pos 0, 'b' on pos 3) hence possible_word[0] == 'a' and possible_word[3] == 'b'

The script is written in 20 minutes just for fun - if you like the simplicity of the approach I can add bs4 and request libraries to make the prediction 100% in 1 attempt (just need to change some request-data that comes to the server, maybe it's just IP-address, maybe smth more complicated, but it's easy to do).
